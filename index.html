    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Jarett Spuck</strong>, a Florida Atlantic University graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Artificial Intelligence (December 2024). I’ve always been the kind of person who can’t leave a problem unsolved, and over time that curiosity turned into a passion for building tools, automating workflows, and creating systems that make life easier, whether it's for myself, friends, family, or at work.</p>

    <p>During my internship at <strong>Cinch Home Services</strong>, I built and deployed a Python-based web scraper that cut manual price checks by 95% and helped the procurement team save 12–18% per order. I didn’t just write code — I delivered something that’s still running in production today. At <strong>Revature</strong>, I’ve been sharpening my skills in enterprise-level development, building backend features with Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and REST APIs, and working in Agile teams to deliver clean, maintainable code.</p>

    <p>This portfolio isn’t just a list of my skills — it’s my way of showing how I think, what I’ve built, and the impact I’ve made. I’ve worked across Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++, built AI-powered learning tools, deployed cloud-based apps on AWS, and collaborated with both technical and non-technical teams to get projects over the finish line.</p>

    <p>I’m driven by the challenge of taking an idea from “what if” to “it’s live and people are using it.” Whether it’s developing smarter automation, creating intuitive user experiences, or tackling complex backend problems, I’m all in.</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by — I’m always open to connecting with people who share the same passion for building, problem-solving, and pushing technology forward.</p>
