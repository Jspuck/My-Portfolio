            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Jarett Spuck</strong>, a graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Artificial Intelligence from Florida Atlantic University. I graduated in December 2024, and I've always been passionate about technology. The thought of being able to create my own scripts and programs is truly amazing because the possibilities are endless.</p>
            
            <p>Through this portfolio, I wanted to go beyond a traditional resume and create something that really showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in coding, web development, data science, and software engineering. I built this website to highlight my growth and journey as a software engineer and to demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.</p>
            
            <p>Rather than just listing my skills on a static page, I aimed to build an interactive and visually appealing platform where potential employers and collaborators can explore my work and gain a deeper understanding of who I am as a developer. My goal is not only to stand out in the competitive tech field but to provide a dynamic way for people and recruiters to engage with my expertise.</p>
            
            <p>My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a constant desire to push myself further and achieve my goals. I have experience building web applications, working with programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++, and deploying projects in real-world environments. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in learning new technologies that emerge every day, exploring ways to create intelligent systems that can make a significant impact and improve both the workplace and the world.</p>
            
            <p>As I continue to grow professionally, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with passionate teams, and refine my skills as a developer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with professionals in the industry!</p>
